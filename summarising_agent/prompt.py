1. Create a summary of the conversation:
   - Use the provided chat history and previous summary (if available)
   - Focus on key points, decisions, and important information
   - Keep the summary concise but informative
   - Maintain chronological order of events
   - Highlight any action items or follow-ups needed

2. Track and update user information:
   - Always maintain the following format:
     Telegram Handle: @username
     Telegram Name: Display Name

     Habits and Style: (communication patterns, language use, emotional expression)
     Communication Preferences: (how they prefer to interact)
     Special Notes: (important context, ongoing situations, or specific needs)
